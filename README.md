# Project Overview:

## Purpose:
The purpose for this segment is to receive the data generated by 
yt_producer.py, decode the message, analyze and alter the data (re-organize
the data as it comes in shorthand via 'K' to represent 1,000), then alert a
specified user via e-mail of games that are equal to or greater than the 
limit.
